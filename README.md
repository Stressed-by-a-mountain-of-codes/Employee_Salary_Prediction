# Employee Salary Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict employee salaries based on features such as education level, years of experience, job role, industry, and location. The goal is to assist HR departments in making data-driven salary decisions, identifying pay gaps, and improving compensation transparency.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Collect Data**  
   - Use datasets containing employee records with salary, experience, education, etc.

2. **Preprocess Data**  
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

3. **Split Dataset**  
   - Divide into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

4. **Train Model**  
   - Use machine learning algorithms to learn from the training data.

5. **Evaluate Model**  
   - Assess model using R¬≤ score, MAE, and RMSE on test data.

6. **Tune & Optimize**  
   - Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

7. **Deploy Model**  
   - Save the best model using `joblib` or `pickle`. Optional: build a UI or API for usage.

## üöß Challenges Faced

- Dealing with missing or inconsistent data
- Choosing appropriate encoding techniques for categorical features
- Avoiding overfitting and underfitting during model training
- Limited availability of clean, labeled salary datasets

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time data input through a web or mobile interface
- Use deep learning or ensemble models for better predictions
- Add additional features like performance ratings, company size, or department
- Implement explainability tools like SHAP or LIME
- Extend the system to predict promotions, attrition, or skill gaps
